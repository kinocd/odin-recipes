        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Creamy Shrimp Pasta reminds me of my favorite dish at Olive Garden. The creamy Alfredo sauce generously coats the juicy shrimp and noodles. Your family will be humming with every bite and will request it for dinner again and again. One of our favorite shrimp recipes!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 lb fettucini pasta</li>
                <li>1 lb large raw shrimp, peeled and devined (21-25 ct)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 onion, (medium), finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
                <li>1/3 cup white wine, I used Chardonnay</li>
                <li>2 cups whipping cream</li>
                <li>1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sea salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp paprika, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped, to garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 3/4 lb pasta to a pot of boiling water with 1 Tbsp salt and cook according to package instructions until al-dente. Drain without rinsing and set aside.</li>
                <li>While pasta is cooking, prepare the shrimp and sauce. Season shrimp with 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp paprika. Place a large, non-stick pan over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, add shrimp in a single layer and cook 2 min per side or just until cooked through and no longer translucent. Remove to a separate dish to prevent overcooking.</li>
                <li>In the same hot pan, add 2 Tbsp butter with finely chopped onion and sauté until soft and golden (3-5 mins), stirring often. Add minced garlic and sauté another minute until fragrant. Stir in 1/3 cup white wine and boil down until there is only 25% of the liquid left.</li>
                <li>Stir in 2 cups cream, bring to a light boil then simmer 2 min. Sprinkle sauce with 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and stir just until creamy and smooth. Let it come just to a simmer without boiling then turn off the heat and season sauce with more salt, pepper and paprika to taste.</li>
                <li>Stir in the drained pasta and cooked shrimp, tossing until noodles are well coated in sauce. Serve in warm pasta bowls with a generous sprinkle of finely chopped parsley, more parmesan cheese and some freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
